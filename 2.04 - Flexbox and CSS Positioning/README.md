# CSS Positioning and Flexbox

## Lesson Objectives

To understand...

- CSS Positioning
- Flexbox

## Intro

CSS Positioning is like playing with building blocks on a webpage. We can move blocks up and down, left and right, and even overlap them! This helps us design websites in different ways and put things where we want them.

Flexbox is a special way of positioning blocks on a webpage. It's like playing with Legos! We can put blocks next to each other, stack them up, and even move them around if we want. This makes it easier to build a webpage that looks good on different devices, like phones and computers. With Flexbox, we can make sure everything fits together nicely, just like Legos.
