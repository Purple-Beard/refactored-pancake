## Intro

CSS Grid is like a chessboard that helps us position things on a webpage. Just like in chess, we have rows and columns that make up the grid. We can put things like pictures, text, and buttons into different squares of the grid.

CSS Grid lets us make some squares bigger or smaller than others. This helps us make complex layouts, like having some things on the left side of the page and some things on the right side. We can even make some squares stretch across multiple rows or columns, which is like making a bigger square on the chessboard.

CSS Grid is a powerful tool that helps us make web pages that look great on different devices. It helps us position things exactly where we want them, so that our website is easy to use and looks good!

### Grid vs Flexbox

CSS Grid and Flexbox are very similar in what they both attempt to improve, positioning on a webpage.

With CSS Grid we can put things in squares, and we can make some squares bigger or smaller than others. This helps us make complex layouts, like having some things on the left side of the page and some things on the right side.

Flexbox is like a line of blocks. We can put blocks next to each other, and we can stack them up. This helps us make simpler layouts, like having things in a row or a column.

So, CSS Grid is good for complex layouts, while Flexbox is good for simpler layouts. Both are important tools for making websites look awesome!
