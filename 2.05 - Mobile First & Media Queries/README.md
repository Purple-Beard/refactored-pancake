## Intro

Mobile First Design means making a website that looks great on a phone first, and then on a computer. It's like starting with a small picture and then making it bigger! This is important because most people use their phones to look at websites, so we want to make sure our website looks good on a small screen.

Media Queries in CSS are like special rules for how a website should look on different devices. We can use media queries to say "If the screen is this big, show this part of the website." This helps us make sure that our website looks good on different devices, like phones, tablets, and computers. Media queries help us make sure that our website looks good no matter what device we use!
