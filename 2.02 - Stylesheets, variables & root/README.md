## Intro

Today we'll be looking at Stylesheets, Variables and the `:root` selector.

### Stylesheets

Stylesheets allow us to write a list of styles/style rules in one `.css` file and tell all our `.html` files to follow those rules, this means that when your client changes their mind about their brand colour we can change it on 1 line instead of 400 lines.

### Variables

With Variables we can name a value like a colour or a measurement (like `12px` for instance) and use that name on several lines instead of the value itself, this means that when your client changes their mind about their brand colour we can change it on 1 line instead of 40 lines.

### `:root` selector

> I am :root!

The `:root` selector allows us to store all of our variables and to define styles about the page that overide the browser's default styles / stylesheet
