## Intro

A good Navbar is like a map for a website. It helps us find what we're looking for quickly and easily. A good Navbar should be easy to use, and it should show us where we are on the website. It should also be clear and simple, so we don't get lost!

To make a good Navbar with CSS, we need to think about a few things. First, we need to choose a good color and font that matches the rest of our website. Then, we need to make sure the Navbar is easy to see, even on a small screen like a phone. We can do this by making the text bigger and by putting the Navbar at the top of the page.

Next, we need to make sure the Navbar is easy to use. We can do this by making the buttons big enough to click on, and by putting them in a logical order. We also need to make sure the buttons change color or show a symbol when we hover over them, so we know where we are on the Navbar.

Finally, we need to make sure the Navbar is responsive. This means that it looks good on different devices, like phones and computers. We can do this by using media queries and by using a special type of CSS called Flexbox. With Flexbox, we can make the Navbar fit the size of the screen, no matter what device we use!
