## Intro

The CSS Box Model is a way to build websites using boxes. Each box is like a container that holds different parts of a webpage, like pictures, text, and buttons. Boxes have different parts, like the content inside, the space around the content called padding, the border around the padding and the space around the border called margin. By changing how big each part of the box is, we can make websites look different and cool!

The Browser Inspector is a visual tool that helps web developers see how their website works on both mobile and desktop web browsers. It lets them look inside the boxes of a website and change things like the colors, size, and position of the parts inside the boxes. This tool helps developers fix any mistakes and make sure their website looks and works just right.
